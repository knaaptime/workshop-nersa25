## Overview

- spatial data and analysis in python
- encoding spatial relationships
- model flows via spatial interaction
- model flows via spatial econometric interaction

## Introduction

open source and open science

- python
- pysal 
- geosnap

## spatial data in python

- pandas
- numpy
- shapely
- geopandas
- census and lodes

## spatial graphs

encoding relationships between spatial objects

- contiguity
- k-nearest neighbors
- distance
- flows

## spatial interaction models

modeling the flow between $o$ and $d$ as a function of push and pull factors

- gravity model (unconstrained) 
- attraction constrained
- production constrained
- doubly constrained

## spatial econometric models

multiple graphs: modeling spatial dependence in the flow between $o$ and $d$ via $^oW$, $^dW$, and $^{od}W$

- spatial dependence
- OD-Graphs
- lag models
- error models
