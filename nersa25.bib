  abstract = {Spatial interaction models of the gravity type are widely used to model origin–destination flows. They draw attention to three types of variables to explain variation in spatial interactions across geographic space: variables that characterize an origin region of a flow, variables that characterize a destination region of a flow, and finally variables that measure the separation between origin and destination regions. This paper outlines and compares two approaches, the spatial econometric and the eigenfunction-based spatial filtering approach, to deal with the issue of spatial autocorrelation among flow residuals. An example using patent citation data that capture knowledge flows across 112 European regions serves to illustrate the application and the comparison of the two approaches.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We apply a Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial interaction model to the paper trail left by patent citations between high-technology patents in Europe to identify and measure spatial separation effects of interregional knowledge flows. The model introduced here is novel in that it allows for spatially structured origin and destination effects for the regions. Estimation of the model is carried out within a Bayesian framework using data augmentation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, related to recent work in Frühwirth-Schnatter and Wagner (2004). This allows MCMC sampling from well-known distribution families, and thus provides a substantial improvement over MCMC estimation based on Metropolis-Hastings sampling from non-standard conditional distributions. Abstract. Hemos aplicado un modelo de interacción espacial de Poisson Bayesiano jerárquico a la siguiendo la pista a documentación que menciona otras patentes entre patentes de alta tecnología en Europa para identificar y medir efectos de separación espacial de flujos de conocimiento interregionales. El modelo aquí introducido es novedoso en cuanto a que admite efectos de origen y destino espacialmente estructurados para las regiones. La estimación del modelo se lleva a cabo bajo un marco Bayesiano usando métodos de aumento de datos y Monte Carlo basado en cadenas de Markov (MCMC), relacionado con investigación reciente de Frühwirth-Schnatter y Wagner (2004). Esto permite el muestreo MCMC de familias de distribución bien conocidas, proporcionando así una mejora substancial sobre estimaciones MCMC basadas en muestreo Metropolis-Hastings de distribuciones condicionales no estándar.},

In economic analysis these objects correspond to economic agents with discrete locations in geographic space, such as addresses, census tracts and regions. In contrast spatial interaction or flow data pertain to measurements each of which is associated with a link or pair of origin-destination locations that represent points or areas in space. While there is a voluminous literature on the specification and estimation of models for cross-sectional object data (see, Chapter C.1 in this volume), less attention has been paid to sample data consisting of origin-destination pairs that form the basic units of analysis in spatial interaction models.},

  abstract = {We introduce a Bayesian hierarchical regression model that extends the traditional least-squares regression model used to estimate gravity or spatial interaction relations involving origin-destination flows. Spatial interaction models attempt to explain variation in flows from n origin regions to n destination regions resulting in a sample of N~=~n2 observations that reflect an n by n flow matrix converted to a vector. Explanatory variables typically include origin and destination characteristics as well as distance between each region and all other regions. Our extension introduces latent spatial effects parameters structured to follow a spatial autoregressive process. Individual effects parameters are included in the model to reflect latent or unobservable influences at work that are unique to each region treated as an origin and destination. That is, we estimate 2n individual effects parameters using the sample of N~=~n2 observations. We illustrate the method using a sample of commodity flows between 18 Spanish regions during the 2002 period.},

  abstract = {Traditional spatial interaction (SI) models of migration are susceptible to misspecification when the spatial structure of locations is not properly incorporated. To address this, a novel SI model for migration is introduced that integrates the theories of competing destinations (CD) and intervening opportunities (IO) to capture multiscale spatial structure using the recent generalized additive spatial smoothing (GASS) framework. This GASS CDIO model can identify the appropriate spatial scales to represent the spatial structure of origins and destinations in a data-driven manner. Validation of the model was conducted through two simulation experiments. The first demonstrates that employing the incorrect scale to capture spatial structure in SI models biases the parameter estimates and increases uncertainty. The second demonstrates that the GASS approach reliably recovers accurate parameters by identifying optimal hyperparameters associated with multiple spatial scales. The GASS CDIO model was then applied to U.S. inter-county migration data and compared to several other model specifications. The results reveal the unique spatial structure from the perspective of origins and destinations and illustrate the improved recoverability of anticipated migration relationships. This work suggests that the GASS CDIO model better integrates spatial theories of migration and accounts for the multiscale nature of SI processes.},

  abstract = {A new technique called generalized additive spatial smoothing (GASS) is introduced for modeling neighborhood effects within a regression framework. GASS has a number of desirable features, namely that it provides a data-driven mechanism for endogenously selecting neighborhoods based on a spatial scale hyperparameter. By allowing different scale hyperparameters to be selected for different relationships in the model, the technique is inherently multiscale and allows neighborhoods to vary by relationship. In addition, GASS includes a measure of uncertainty associated with each scale hyperparameter. These characteristics make it attractive for modeling phenomena where proximity might be an important aspect of a process, especially when a clear definition of proximity is not immediately available. Through multiscale data-driven spatial smoothing, GASS conducts a form of change of support and therefore also facilitates the incorporation of data from diverse sources. Finally, the technique is flexible and can be adapted and expanded with relative ease because it builds on generalized additive modeling. After providing an overview of the methodology, including a modified backfitting algorithm for calibration, a simulation experiment is described and an empirical example modeling bike-share usage is presented. The simulation results indicate that GASS can generally produce reliable results pertaining to both the regression coefficients and scale hyperparameters, and the results from the empirical example demonstrate that the GASS approach provides a better model fit and captures relationships that might otherwise be obfuscated. Overall, these results highlight the potential of the GASS framework and the importance of measuring multiscale neighborhood effects.},
