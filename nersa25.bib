  abstract = {Spatial interaction models of the gravity type are widely used to model origin–destination flows. They draw attention to three types of variables to explain variation in spatial interactions across geographic space: variables that characterize an origin region of a flow, variables that characterize a destination region of a flow, and finally variables that measure the separation between origin and destination regions. This paper outlines and compares two approaches, the spatial econometric and the eigenfunction-based spatial filtering approach, to deal with the issue of spatial autocorrelation among flow residuals. An example using patent citation data that capture knowledge flows across 112 European regions serves to illustrate the application and the comparison of the two approaches.},

  abstract = {Spatial interaction (SI) is the process whereby entities at different points in physical space make contacts, demand/supply decisions or locational choices. The entities can be individuals or firms and the choices can include housing, jobs, production quantities, exports, imports, face-to-face contacts, schools, retail centres and activity centres. The first SI models can be grouped under the generic heading gravity models. Their main characteristic is that they model the behaviour of demand or supply segments, rather than that of individuals and firms. This article traces the development of these models from their inception in the early part of the twentieth century to the present. The key advances include the replacement of the gravity analogy by the more general concepts of entropy or information theory, a statistical framework commonly used in physics. With the arrival of the regional science paradigm over 50 years ago, a key challenge has been to broaden these models compared to those arising in spatial economics, thus arriving at a more inclusive probabilistic framework. These efforts are discussed here, as well as inclusion of geographical advances, embracing activities as generators of travel, time-geography, recognition of spatial interdependencies, and use of neuro-computing principles.},

We apply a Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial interaction model to the paper trail left by patent citations between high-technology patents in Europe to identify and measure spatial separation effects of interregional knowledge flows. The model introduced here is novel in that it allows for spatially structured origin and destination effects for the regions. Estimation of the model is carried out within a Bayesian framework using data augmentation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, related to recent work in Frühwirth-Schnatter and Wagner (2004). This allows MCMC sampling from well-known distribution families, and thus provides a substantial improvement over MCMC estimation based on Metropolis-Hastings sampling from non-standard conditional distributions.

Explanatory variables typically include origin and destination characteristics as well as distance between each region and all other regions. Our extension introduces latent spatial effects parameters structured to follow a spatial autoregressive process. Individual effects parameters are included in the model to reflect latent or unobservable influences at work that are unique to each region treated as an origin and destination. That is, we estimate 2n individual effects parameters using the sample of N~=~n2 observations.

  abstract = {ABSTRACTTraditional spatial interaction (SI) models of migration are susceptible to misspecification when the spatial structure of locations is not properly incorporated. To address this, a novel SI model for migration is introduced that integrates the theories of competing destinations (CD) and intervening opportunities (IO) to capture multiscale spatial structure using the recent generalized additive spatial smoothing (GASS) framework. This GASS CDIO model can identify the appropriate spatial scales to represent the spatial structure of origins and destinations in a data‐driven manner. Validation of the model was conducted through two simulation experiments. The first demonstrates that employing the incorrect scale to capture spatial structure in SI models biases the parameter estimates and increases uncertainty. The second demonstrates that the GASS approach reliably recovers accurate parameters by identifying optimal hyperparameters associated with multiple spatial scales. The GASS CDIO model was then applied to U.S. inter‐county migration data and compared to several other model specifications. The results reveal the unique spatial structure from the perspective of origins and destinations and illustrate the improved recoverability of anticipated migration relationships. This work suggests that the GASS CDIO model better integrates spatial theories of migration and accounts for the multiscale nature of SI processes.},

Spatial choice modelling is viewed as a distinct area of research, within the larger field of discrete choice modelling, with a sound methodological basis and computationally tractable modelling framework. This review draws upon empirical application of spatial choice models to interregional migration and identifies the main research issues, summarizes the progress of research thus far, and suggests some paths for future research. It is argued that some of the widely used models suffer from problems derived from their development in aspatial choice contexts. Acknowledging the increased complexity and, possibly, the different choice process that spatial choice situations present over their aspatial counterparts leads to the development of the socalled competing destinations model and its variants. Evidence from empirical tests of these spatial choice models suggests that analysts engaged in interregional migration modelling risk model misspecification if they ignore the peculiarities of spatial choice.},

Of the work which has been published, all of it has dealt almost exclusively with single-parameter spatial interaction models. In this article five different aggregation procedures are examined. The experiments were based on the use of a multivariate multiparametric spatial interaction model. A first set of hypotheses tests was performed with respect to the sensitivity of model parameters to spatial aggregation methods. A second set was performed with respect to the sensitivity of model goodness-of-fit to the five spatial aggregation methods. Although questions remain, the results clearly show that the multiparametric model responds well to different aggregation algorithms. Some parameters showed substantial response, as they should, to different zonal aggregations, whereas others are shown to be much less responsive. Further, the results clearly indicate that systematic aggregation procedures generally produce better results than do random procedures. A future paper will continue with a discussion of zone definition criteria, and recommendations will be made with regard to aggregation algorithms.},

  abstract = {PySAL is a library for geocomputation and spatial data science. Written in Python, the library has a long history of supporting novel scholarship and broadening methodological impacts far afield of academic work. Recently, many new techniques, methods of analyses, and development modes have been implemented, making the library much larger and more encompassing than that previously discussed in the literature. As such, we provide an introduction to the library as it stands now, as well as the scientific and conceptual underpinnings of its core set of components. Finally, we provide a prospective look at the library's future evolution.},

  abstract = {Although economists have long been aware of Jensen's inequality, many econometric applications have neglected an important implication of it: under heteroskedasticity, the parameters of log-linearized models estimated by OLS lead to biased estimates of the true elasticities. We explain why this problem arises and propose an appropriate estimator. Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated. We develop the argument using one particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade. We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.
